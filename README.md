## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
**❌ Script is Not Digitally Signed**

If you see this error:

.\SystemHealthCheck.ps1 cannot be loaded because it is not digitally signed.

🔧 Run this to allow the script temporarily:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

Then re-run the script:

.\SystemHealthCheck.ps1

    This change only affects the current PowerShell session and does not permanently reduce system security.
